* Wanderlust Folder Integration[0%]
  Or MIME-View integration.
** TODO Consider reciever?
   We know that the reciever are the same user who check the mails... We should consider him?

   Suppose we recieve an email from a group of users. It's may be not the same address of ours.

** TODO Filter out empty or "noreply" entries
   Empty entries, or mails with "noreply" are considered as normal entries.
   
   In this cases we must ignore it.

   The most common way to do this is to give a customizable option to the user with a default behavior. Maybe a regexp or a list of regexps.
** TODO If a name exists already, but the mail address is new, add the mail 
   If the name is in the BBDB, but the email address isn't the same, the BBDBV3 must add it as an alternative or another mail address of the user.

** TODO Recognize address formats in the mails
   We should use a configurable regexp to recognize address directions.
   
   If user wants to add it, insert in the correct entry in the BBDB.
** TODO Recognize telephones formats in the mails
   We should use a configurable regexp to recognize telephones. 
   
   And, if user wants, add it in the correct entry in the BBDB.
** TODO Recognize "aka's"
   Idem
* Wandrelust Addressbook Integration[0%]
** TODO Sinchronization for the Addressbook
   The addressbook must be up-to date. 

   The sinchronization must be both sides: 
   - From BBDB V3 to Addressbook
   - From Addressbook to BBDB.

   The problem is that the addressbook mustn't have to much entries. 
   So We have to re-consider the last way.

   Remember, when BBDB-WL has to do the sinchronization? 
   1) At startup: But any new entry in the addressbook won't be reflected in the BBDB unless the functions or hooks are modified.
   2) At the end: BBDB won't have the addressbook entries, unless a function for sinchronization is called at startup.
   3) Both? 
   4) At user request.

** TODO Updating the Addressbook to BBDB can make conflicts 
   Two persons can be called in the same way, what happens there?

   For example:

   You have two Peters in the addressbook, you have to update BBDB. Which you have to update?

   If you run =bbdb-wl-take-data-from-addressbook= will try to update Peters with BBDB's Peters. In that case which Peter are the one selected?

   The computer must ask the user which Peter to update with the information selected. The message may show:

   "There are two records that answer the name Peter. Which one update with this data?
   Data:
   Peter - Aka: Peter_a - peter_a@mail1.com
   Peter - Aka: Peter_b - peter_b@mail2.com
   Choices:
   Peter Billy
   Peter Aston."

** TODO bbdb-wl-update-record doesn't update really, it set!
   This function =bbdb-wl-update-record= doesn't update, instead it change the attributes.
   
* Mime-Edit Integration[0%]
** TODO Inserting addresses in the "To:" field
   Emails addresses in the Big Brother Database can be used for inserting in the "To:", "BCC:" and/or "CC:" fields.

   BBDB-WL must provide a function, and keys access for use BBDB to insert addresses into Mime-edit mayor mode. 
   It could be the same BBDB-Wl keys as the last version(BBDB V2.x).
