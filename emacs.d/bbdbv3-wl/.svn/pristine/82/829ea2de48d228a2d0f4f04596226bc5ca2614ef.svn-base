  The intention is to maintain an organized list of every function that the user can call using M-x or by a sequence of keys.


* Mime View Mode
  
  This adds functionality for searching a person data from the sender's e-mail address. Useful when you are using the Wanderlust's Summary and reading mails with the "n" key.
