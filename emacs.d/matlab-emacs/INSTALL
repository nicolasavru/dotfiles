Installation:

** DEPENDANCIES

This matlab-emacs build system now requires the CEDET suite.

   http://cedet.sf.net

The build system uses EDE for project management, Makefile creation,
and autoload generation.

To build if CEDET is installed in ../cedet:

  make

To build if CEDET is installed in some other location:

   make "LOADPATH=../cedet-VER/common ../cedet-VER/eieio ../cedet-VER/semantic/bovine/ ../cedet-VER/semantic/"

where ../cedet-VER is a full or relative path to the CEDET suite.  If
you get CEDET from CVS, then it is likey just "../cedet", if you use
CEDET from a release, then it may be "../cedet-1.0pre6", or similar.

This tool requires CEDET 1.0pre3 or later.

If you have CEDET installed in "../cedet" then you do not need to
specify a LOADPATH on the make command line.

It is possible to use matlab.el, and associated programs without this
extra package.  To do so, install and compile only those lisp files
you need.

** FULL INSTALL

To install all the Emacs tools for MATLAB, add this to your .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/matlab_el")
  (require 'matlab-load)

** matlab.el:

If you want to only use matlab.el for editing your code, and do not
want to try the other tools, you can do that also, though the install
code you need is more complex:


Put the this file as "matlab.el" somewhere on your load path, then
add this to your .emacs or site-init.el file:

  (autoload 'matlab-mode "matlab" "Enter MATLAB mode." t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.m\\'" . matlab-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (autoload 'matlab-shell "matlab" "Interactive MATLAB mode." t)

User Level customizations (You need not use them all):
  (setq matlab-indent-function-body t)  ; if you want function bodies indented
  (setq matlab-verify-on-save-flag nil) ; turn off auto-verify on save
  (defun my-matlab-mode-hook ()
    (setq fill-column 76))		; where auto-fill should wrap
  (add-hook 'matlab-mode-hook 'my-matlab-mode-hook)
  (defun my-matlab-shell-mode-hook ()
	'())
  (add-hook 'matlab-shell-mode-hook 'my-matlab-shell-mode-hook)

Please read the mode help for matlab-mode for additional
configuration options.

Syntax highlighting:
  To get font-lock try adding this for older emacsen:
    (font-lock-mode 1)
  Or for newer versions of Emacs:
    (global-font-lock-mode t)
  To get hilit19 support try adding:
    (matlab-mode-hilit)

This package requires easymenu, tempo, and derived.
This package will optionally use custom, shell, and gud.
This package supports language specific extensions in imenu, func-menu,
     speedbar, font-lock, and hilit19.

** tlc.el

To use this mode without using the full instatll, put the this file
into your load path, and add the following to your .emacs file:

  (require 'tlc)
or
  (autoload 'tlc-mode "tlc" "tlc Editing Mode" t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.tlc$" . tlc-mode))
  (setq tlc-indent-function t)


** semantic-matlab.el, semanticdb-matlab.el


Note that this feature requires CEDET 1.0pre4 or newer.
